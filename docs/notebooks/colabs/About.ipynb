    "These ubiquitous operations are at the heart of principal component analysis, Gaussian processes, normalizing flows, equivariant neural networks, and many other applications.\n",

    "For example, a user can call inverse or eig on any `LinearOperator`, and under-the-hood our framework derives a computationally efficient algorithm built from roughly 70 compositional _dispatch rules_. If little is known about the `LinearOperator`, the derived algorithm reverts to a general-purpose base case (e.g. Gaussian elimination or GMRES for linear solves). Conversely, if the `LinearOperator` is known to be the Kronecker product of a lower triangular matrix and a positive definite Toeplitz matrix, the derived algorithm uses specialty algorithms for Kronecker, triangular, and positive definite matrices. Through this compositional pattern matching,\n",

Some of the dispatch rules can be derived from a combination of previous ones (red square)."
